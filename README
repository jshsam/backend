Summary:

    backend is my application for the backend-assessment - Blog Posts project. 
The entry point for this application is app.js located in the src folder. In here I set up the app and port. 
Inside the /src/api-routes folder I have the ping.js file and the posts.js file.
ping.js is where I set up the ping .get request. posts.js is where I set up the posts.get request.
Both of these get requests have their business-logic set up in respective files located in /src/services.
Inside src/service I have ping-logic.js and posts-logic.js that has all the necessary code for the get requests.
Inside /src/__tests__ is located postApi.spec.js where all my tests are located. I used jest.js for testing.
To cache I used npm 'apicache'. 

Commands:

Install cmd is: npm install
Run cmd is:  npm start
Test cmd is: npm test
Port: 3000

Instructions:

    Run cmd starts the server. I used Insomnia to test my connections with http://localhost:3000/api/ping for the ping route 
and http://localhost:3000/api/posts/:tag/:sortBy?/:direction?. For the posts route substitute :tag with 'tag=tagName' where 
tagName is any tag and if more than one separate them by comma. Substitute :sortBy? with 'sortBy=sortByOption' where sortByOption 
is one of 4 valid sortBy options: id, reads, likes, popularity. And substitute :direction? with 'direction=directionValue' where 
directionValue is one of two valid directions: asc, desc. Tag is a required parameter while sortBy and direction are not. if either
or both sortBy and direction are not included they will go to their default value. sortBy default is 'id' and direction default is 'asc'.
To test type npm test in terminal.
